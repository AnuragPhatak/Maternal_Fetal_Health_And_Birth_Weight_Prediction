# **Maternal & Fetal Health Prediction and Birth Weight Prediction ðŸš€**

Developed an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** focused on predicting maternal health risks, fetal health outcomes, and newborn birth weight. The project followed a **structured ML pipeline**:  

## **ðŸ”„ Workflow:**  
- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Collected and cleaned extensive healthcare datasets.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key patterns and trends to uncover critical health risk factors.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful features to improve model accuracy.  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Validated assumptions for statistical significance.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Applied robust machine learning techniques for both classification and regression tasks.  
- **Deployment:** Streamlined user access via an interactive Streamlit app.  

## **ðŸ“Š Models Developed:**  
1. **Maternal Health Prediction:** Classification model to identify maternal health risks.  
2. **Fetal Health Prediction:** Classification model predicting fetal health categories with high accuracy.  
3. **Birth Weight Prediction:** Regression model accurately estimating newborn weight.  

## **ðŸŒŸ Achievements:**  
- Delivered actionable health risk insights to assist healthcare professionals in proactive decision-making.  
- User-friendly web interface for seamless predictions and accessibility.  
- Improved prediction accuracy using optimized hyperparameters and feature selection techniques.
